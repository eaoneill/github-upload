participants, there is no predictor variable that significantly predicts whether or not the equipment fails

summary(lm(eodata$Fail. ~ eodata$age))
age does not predict (R2 = .04, p = .3787)

summary(lm(eodata$Fail. ~ eodata$area.1))
made area into regions: does not predict (R2 = .1427, p = .4685)

summary(lm(eodata$Fail. ~ eodata$years))
years does not predict (R2 = .06, p = .2863)

summary(lm(eodata$Fail. ~ eodata$body.))
whether or not the injury being of the body (I guessed on some) did not predict (R2 = .02, p = .6051)

summary(lm(eodata$Fail. ~ eodata$own.rent.equipment))
whether they own or rent did not predict (R2 = .03, p = .4401)

summary(lm(eodata$Fail. ~ eodata$Part))
coded participation in sport, did not predict (R2 = .02, p = .5449)

 coded your barriers (equipment v not equipment)
summary(lm(eodata$barriers..equip. ~ eodata$age))
age did not predict (R2 = .01, p = .6681)

Area actually did predict!!
summary(lm(eodata$barriers..equip. ~ eodata$area.1))
Regression equation: 1 - .33846 *east - 1 *mid - 1 * west  = predicted barriers being equipment based (R2 = .2692, p = .04612)
west and mid significantly lower 
Therefore, people in the east are more likely to have barriers due to the equipment!

summary(lm(eodata$barriers..equip. ~ eodata$years))
year did not predict (R2 = .02, p = .5735)

summary(lm(eodata$barriers..equip. ~ eodata$body.))
Body v mind injury did not predict (R2 = .04, p = .388)

summary(lm(eodata$barriers..equip. ~ eodata$own.rent.equipment))
own v rent did not predict (R2 = .02, p = .556)

summary(lm(eodata$barriers..equip. ~ eodata$Part))
participation in sport prior does not predict (R2 = .1525, p = .08864)

Instructor data.

cor.test(idata$age, idata$years)
Sanity check - age is significantly correlated with years (which I'm assuming is years of instruction, makes sense)    r = .625, p < .001

Coded difficult part of teaching being equipment and tested if we could predict.

summary(lm(idata$equipment.diff. ~ idata$age))
not with age (R2 = .03, p = .1786)

summary(lm(idata$equipment.diff. ~ idata$years))
not with years experience (R2 = .02, p = .2267)

summary(lm(idata$equipment.diff. ~ idata$instruct))
Years of experience? I'm really not sure what that was but not sig (R2 = .002, p = .7227)

summary(lm(idata$equipment.diff. ~ idata$area.coded))
Area "approaching sig" (that's not really a thing, but people say it all the time)
R2 = .09, p = .05
predicted equipment difficult = .179 - .179 * mid +. 241 * west
Therefore, west is more likely to have problems of equipment (p of west regression coefficient = .0404)

summary(lm(idata$equipment.diff. ~ idata$type..ski.board.))
type not sig (R2 = .08, p = .2913)


Coded difficult part of teaching being communication and tested if we could predict.

summary(lm(idata$communication. ~ idata$age))
age not sig predictor (R2 = .03, p = .159)

summary(lm(idata$communication. ~ idata$years))
years not sig (R2 = .02, p = .3363)

summary(lm(idata$communication. ~ idata$instruct))
instruct not sig (R2 = .04, p = .121)

summary(lm(idata$communication.~ idata$area.coded))
area coded not sig (R2 = .005, p = .8662)

summary(lm(idata$communication. ~ idata$type..ski.board.))
type not sig (R2 = .10, p = .165)
